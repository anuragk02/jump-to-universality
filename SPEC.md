## Architecture
Server:
- The Data Layer will be built using Neo4j on AuraDB and the API Layer will be written in Go.

## Guidelines
- Do not make assumptions that might lead to unnecessary code changes.
- If instructions are not clear, ask for a more clear task.
- Code must only be added or removed in order to solve problems, be a minimalist in terms of making changes.
- Read ROADMAP.md, updated with the goals for the project.
- At the start of every session, read the LASTCHANGELOG.md file which is a summary of the last session.
- At the end of each session:
  - Add the current session's changes to CHANGELOG.md (cumulative history)
  - Replace LASTCHANGELOG.md content with only the current session's changes
